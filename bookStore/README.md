# BookStore

This project is created according to the ngrx walkthrough tutorial https://ngrx.io/guide/store/walkthrough  
I implemented it in an iterative way and not strictly in the order it was described in to better understand in details how things work.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
